# 🐾 Winking and Smiling Fox

This p5.js project of mine displays an interactive fox character that changes according to mouse clicks by winking and smiling. It’s a fun, beginner animation project I built using shapes, colors, and simple interactivity.

## 💡 Features in the project

There is a cute animated fox character which is made using ellipses and rectangles. You can interact with the fox by clicking anywhere on the canvas to change the fox between:
  * Normal expression (both eyes open, neutral mouth)
  * Winking expression (one eye closed, smiling)

## 🛠️ Built With

* p5.js – a JavaScript library

## 🧠 Learning Concepts

This project helped me understand how to use conditionals like if-else for interactivity in the project. Drawing with shapes and colors and how to structure all the code using `setup()` and `draw()`.
