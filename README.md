* Interactive: click anywhere on the canvas to toggle between:

  * Normal expression (both eyes open, neutral mouth)

## 🧠 Learning Concepts

This project helped me understand:

* How to use conditionals (`if-else`) for interactivity
* Drawing with basic shapes and colors
* How to structure a p5.js sketch with `setup()`, `draw()`, and custom event handlers
